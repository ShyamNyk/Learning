-- What is Rolling update ?
Users expect applications to be available all the time and developers are expected to deploy 
new versions of them several times a day. In Kubernetes this is done with 
rolling updates. Rolling updates allow Deployments' update to take place with zero 
downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones. The new Pods will 
be scheduled on Nodes with available resources.

Similar to application Scaling, if a Deployment is exposed publicly, the Service will load-balance the traffic only to available Pods during the update. An available Pod is an instance that is available to the users of the application.

Rolling updates allow the following actions:

Promote an application from one environment to another (via container image updates)
Rollback to previous versions
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of applications with zero downtime
