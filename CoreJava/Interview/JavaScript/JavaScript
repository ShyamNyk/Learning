1)Difference between == and === operator in JavaScript
The ‘==’ operator tests for abstract equality i.e. it does the necessary type conversions before doing the equality comparison.
But the ‘===’ operator tests for strict equality i.e it will not do the type conversion hence if the two values are not of the same type, when compared, it will return false.
    document.write(9 == "9");  
    document.write('<br>') 
true
false
