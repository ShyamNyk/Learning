--Q) Difference between Dependency and Dependency management in maven ?
For a small project, you can just have all your dependencies listed in 
<dependencies> section. But, for a multi-module project, and projects that require 
management of versions of dependencies, it is always better to manage the 
dependencies using <dependencyManagement>. Whichever dependency you defined in 
<dependencyManagement> and used in <dependencies>, it becomes a managed dependency.
