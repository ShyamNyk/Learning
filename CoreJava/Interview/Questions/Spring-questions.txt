Q) Difference between path variable and request param ?
===========================================================
Both are used to extract data from URL

- The @RequestParam is used to extract query parameters while @PathVariable is used to extract data right from the URI.

- @RequestParam is more useful on a traditional web application where data is mostly passed in the query abatements while @PathVariable is more suitable for RESTful web services where URL contains values, e.g. http://localhost:8080/book/9783827319333, here data, which is ISBN number is part of URI.

- @RequestParam annotation can specify default values if a query parameter is not present or empty by using a defaultValue attribute, provided the required attribute is false.
