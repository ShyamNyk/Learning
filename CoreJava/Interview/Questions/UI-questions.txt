Angular:
1) Difference between angular component and angular directive ?
Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.
Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data.

Directives are js class and declared as @directive. There are 3 directives in Angular.

Component Directives
Structural Directives
Attribute Directives
Component Directives: Component directives are used in main class. They contain the detail of how the component should be processed, instantiated and used at runtime.

Structural Directives: Structural directives start with a * sign. These directives are used to manipulate and change the structure of the DOM elements. For example, *ngIf and *ngFor.

Attribute Directives: Attribute directives are used to change the look and behavior of the DOM elements. For example: ngClass, ngStyle etc.
