/*So in this java garbage collection tutorial, we learned the following –

Object life cycle is devided into 3 phases i.e. object creation, object in use and object destruction.
How mark-sweep, mark-sweep-compact and mark-copy mechanisms woks.
Different single threaded and concurrent GC algorithms.
Till java 8, parallel GC was default algorithm.
Since java 9, G1 has been set as default GC algorithm.
Also, various flags to control the garbage collection algorithm’s behavior and log useful information for any application.
