1) What will happen if we are using a Custom object as a key in hashMap in case
- hashcode method is not implemented and equals method is implemented?

- equals method is not overridden ?

2) How to use a custom object as Key in HashMap ?

3) What is the hash function in hashMap/how the index is calculated ?
		return hashCode(key) & (n-1)
		
4) Load factor of HashMap = 0.75, capacity gets doubled
The initial default capacity of Hashtable class is 11 whereas loadFactor is 0.75

-- The Hashtable class has all its methods synchronized 
i.e. the locking is done at the method level

-- Difference between hashMap, linkedHashMap, TreeMap
