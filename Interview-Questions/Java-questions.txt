32)Why String class is immutable even though it has a non -final field called “hash”
When the ratio of entries to the size of a main array exceeds a certain value (the "load factor") the HashMap implementation expands the array. When this happens, all existing entries need to be redistributed to new hash chains ... based on the entry keys' has values. The hash values are stored in the Entry objects so that they doesn't have to be recalculated each time the entries need to be redistributed.

1) Detection of a loop insise a linked list
2) Add two numbers represented by linked lists
