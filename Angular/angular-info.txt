Proxy server acts as a middle-man(gateway) between server(internet) and client serving computers(you).we use proxy server for various purpose like sharing internet connections on a local area network, hide our IP address, implement internet access control, access blocked websites and so on. If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.If that’s all it does, why bother with a proxy server? 
Why not just go straight from to the website and back?
Modern proxy servers do much more than forwarding web requests, all in the name of data security and network performance. Proxy servers act as a firewall and web filter, provide shared network connections, and cache data to speed up common requests. A good proxy server keeps users and the internal network protected from the bad stuff that lives out in the wild internet. Lastly, proxy servers can provide a high level of privacy.
